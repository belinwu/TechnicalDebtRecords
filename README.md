## Introduction

In software development, managing technical debt is crucial for maintaining code quality, ensuring scalability, and facilitating future enhancements. This repository provides a Go-based tool to generate **Technical Debt Records (TDRs)** in various formats, aiding teams in systematically documenting and addressing technical debt within their projects.

## What is a Technical Debt Record (TDR)?

A **Technical Debt Record (TDR)** is a structured document that captures details about technical debt within a software project. Technical debt refers to the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer. TDRs help teams track, analyze, and prioritize technical debt, ensuring informed decision-making and strategic planning for codebase improvements.

## Motivation for TDRs

Technical debt, if left unmanaged, can accumulate over time, leading to increased maintenance costs, reduced agility, and potential system failures. The primary motivations for maintaining TDRs include:

- **Visibility:** Providing clear insights into existing technical debt.
- **Accountability:** Assigning responsibility for addressing specific debts.
- **Prioritization:** Evaluating the impact and urgency of each debt item.
- **Strategic Planning:** Informing long-term architectural and development decisions.

By systematically recording technical debt, teams can proactively manage and mitigate its adverse effects on the project.

## Fields in a TDR

A comprehensive TDR encompasses several fields, each detailing specific aspects of the technical debt. Below are the primary fields included in the TDR generated by this tool:

1. **Title:** A concise name for the technical debt.
2. **Author:** The individual who identified or is documenting the debt.
3. **Version:** The version of the project or component where the debt exists.
4. **Date:** The date when the debt was identified or recorded.
5. **State:** The current workflow stage of the technical debt (e.g., Identified, Analyzed, Approved, In Progress, Resolved, Closed, Rejected).
6. **Relations:** Links to other related TDRs, establishing connections between different debt items.
7. **Summary:** A brief overview explaining the nature and context of the technical debt.
8. **Context:** Detailed background information, including why the debt was incurred (e.g., rushed deadlines, outdated technologies).
9. **Impact:**
   - **Technical Impact:** How the debt affects system performance, scalability, maintainability, etc.
   - **Business Impact:** The repercussions on business operations, customer satisfaction, risk levels, etc.
10. **Symptoms:** Observable signs indicating the presence of the technical debt (e.g., frequent bugs, slow performance).
11. **Severity:** The criticality level of the debt (Critical, High, Medium, Low).
12. **Potential Risks:** Possible adverse outcomes if the debt remains unaddressed (e.g., security vulnerabilities, increased costs).
13. **Proposed Solution:** Recommended actions or strategies to resolve the debt.
14. **Cost of Delay:** Consequences of postponing the resolution of the debt.
15. **Effort to Resolve:** Estimated resources, time, and effort required to address the debt.
16. **Dependencies:** Other tasks, components, or external factors that the resolution of the debt depends on.
17. **Additional Notes:** Any other relevant information or considerations related to the debt.

## Benefits of TDRs

Maintaining TDRs offers several advantages to software development teams:

- **Improved Code Quality:** By identifying and addressing technical debt, teams can enhance the overall quality and reliability of the codebase.
- **Enhanced Project Planning:** TDRs provide valuable data for sprint planning, backlog prioritization, and resource allocation.
- **Risk Mitigation:** Understanding the potential risks associated with technical debt allows teams to proactively address issues before they escalate.
- **Knowledge Sharing:** TDRs serve as documentation that can be referenced by current and future team members, fostering a shared understanding of the project's technical landscape.
- **Strategic Decision-Making:** Comprehensive records enable informed decisions regarding when to invest in refactoring, upgrading technologies, or implementing new features.

## Relation to Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

**Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** are documents that capture important architectural decisions made during a project's lifecycle. They provide context and rationale behind choices that shape the system's structure and behavior.

**Technical Debt Records (TDRs)** are motivated by ADRs in the following ways:

- **Contextual Continuity:** ADRs often highlight areas where technical debt was incurred due to architectural choices. TDRs extend this by documenting the debt's specifics and its implications.
- **Decision Impact Analysis:** By maintaining TDRs alongside ADRs, teams can assess how past decisions continue to affect the project and address any resulting technical debt.
- **Holistic Documentation:** Together, ADRs and TDRs offer a comprehensive view of both the strategic decisions and their technical repercussions, enabling better governance and continuous improvement.

## Using the TDR Generator Program

This Go-based tool facilitates the creation of TDRs in multiple formats. Below is a guide on how to set up and use the program effectively.

### Prerequisites

- **Go Programming Language:** Ensure that Go is installed on your machine. You can download it from the [official website](https://golang.org/dl/).
- **Git (Optional):** For version control and integration purposes.

### Installation

```bash
go install github.com/ms1963/TechnicalDebtRecords/src@latest
```

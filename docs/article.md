# Technical Debt Records (TDRs) and the Tool to Create Them

## Introduction

In today's fast-paced software development landscape, teams face the challenge of continuously delivering new features while maintaining code quality. This often leads to compromises known as **Technical Debt**. To systematically document and manage this debt, **Technical Debt Records (TDRs)** have emerged as a vital tool. This article explores the significance of TDRs, how they benefit developers, architects, and testers, and introduces a tool that simplifies the creation of TDRs.

## What are Technical Debt Records (TDRs)?

A **Technical Debt Record (TDR)** is a structured document that captures details about technical debt within a software project. Technical debt arises when short-term solutions are chosen for immediate gains, leading to increased maintenance costs, reduced performance, or other long-term disadvantages. TDRs provide a clear overview of existing technical debt, its impacts, and the measures needed to address it.

## Motivation for TDRs

Unmanaged technical debt can accumulate over time, resulting in significant negative consequences:

- **Code Quality:** Increased maintenance efforts and declining code quality.
- **Scalability:** Challenges in scaling and adapting the software.
- **Performance:** Potential performance degradation due to suboptimal implementations.
- **Risk Management:** Elevated risks of system failures or security vulnerabilities.

By systematically documenting technical debt through TDRs, teams can proactively identify, prioritize, and address these issues before they become unmanageable.

## Benefits of TDRs for Developers, Architects, and Testers

### For Developers

- **Transparency:** Clear documentation of existing technical debt enhances understanding of the codebase.
- **Prioritization:** Helps focus on critical areas that require immediate attention.
- **Reusability:** Awareness of known issues prevents duplicate efforts in troubleshooting and fixing problems.

### For Architects

- **Strategic Planning:** Assists in planning refactoring efforts and architectural improvements.
- **Risk Assessment:** Evaluates the impact of technical debt on the overall system architecture.
- **Decision-Making:** Provides data-driven insights for making informed decisions about system evolution.

### For Testers

- **Focused Testing:** Knowledge of problematic areas allows for more targeted and effective testing strategies.
- **Enhanced Test Coverage:** Ensures that areas affected by technical debt receive adequate testing attention.
- **Quality Assurance:** Guarantees that resolved debts contribute to overall software quality improvements.

## The TDR Template and Its Fields

A well-structured TDR template is crucial for effective documentation of technical debt. The tool we present generates TDRs with the following fields:

1. **Title:** A concise name for the technical debt.
2. **Author:** The individual who identified or is documenting the debt.
3. **Version:** The version of the project or component where the debt exists.
4. **Date:** The date when the debt was identified or recorded.
5. **State:** The current workflow stage of the technical debt (e.g., Identified, Analyzed, Approved, In Progress, Resolved, Closed, Rejected).
6. **Relations:** Links to other related TDRs to establish connections between different debt items.
7. **Summary:** A brief overview explaining the nature and significance of the technical debt.
8. **Context:** Detailed background information, including why the debt was incurred (e.g., time constraints, outdated technologies).
9. **Impact:**
   - **Technical Impact:** How the debt affects system performance, scalability, maintainability, etc.
   - **Business Impact:** The repercussions on business operations, customer satisfaction, risk levels, etc.
10. **Symptoms:** Observable signs indicating the presence of technical debt (e.g., frequent bugs, slow performance).
11. **Severity:** The criticality level of the debt (Critical, High, Medium, Low).
12. **Potential Risks:** Possible adverse outcomes if the debt remains unaddressed (e.g., security vulnerabilities, increased costs).
13. **Proposed Solution:** Recommended actions or strategies to resolve the debt.
14. **Cost of Delay:** Consequences of postponing the resolution of the debt.
15. **Effort to Resolve:** Estimated resources, time, and effort required to address the debt.
16. **Dependencies:** Other tasks, components, or external factors that the resolution of the debt depends on.
17. **Additional Notes:** Any other relevant information or considerations related to the debt.

### Rationale for the `State` Field

The `State` field reflects the workflow stages of handling technical debt. It helps track the progress of each debt item and ensures that no debts remain unattended. The defined states are:

- **Identified:** The technical debt has been recognized.
- **Analyzed:** The impact and effort required to address the debt have been assessed.
- **Approved:** The resolution of the technical debt has been approved.
- **In Progress:** Work to resolve the technical debt is underway.
- **Resolved:** The technical debt has been addressed.
- **Closed:** The technical debt record is closed.
- **Rejected:** The resolution of the technical debt has been rejected.

### Adjusting Fields Based on State

When initially identifying a technical debt, some fields may remain empty and be filled out as the debt progresses through different states:

- **Initial Identification (`Identified`):**
  - **Filled:** Title, Author, Version, Date, State, Summary, Context.
  - **Empty:** Impact, Symptoms, Severity, Potential Risks, Proposed Solution, Cost of Delay, Effort to Resolve, Dependencies, Additional Notes.

- **Analysis Phase (`Analyzed`):**
  - **Filled:** All fields from `Identified` plus Impact, Symptoms, Severity, Potential Risks.

- **Approval Phase (`Approved`):**
  - **Filled:** All previous fields plus Proposed Solution, Cost of Delay.

- **Implementation Phase (`In Progress`):**
  - **Filled:** All previous fields plus Effort to Resolve, Dependencies.

- **Completion Phase (`Resolved` & `Closed`):**
  - **Filled:** All fields including Additional Notes.

This phased approach ensures that TDRs remain up-to-date and accurately reflect the current status of each technical debt item.

1. **Check TDRs into Version Control:**

   - **Git:** Commit TDRs to your Git repository alongside your code. This approach ensures that TDRs are versioned and can be reviewed, branched, and merged similarly to your source code.
     
     **Example:**
     ```bash
     git add technical_debt_record.md
     git commit -m "Add TDR for Outdated Authentication Library"
     git push origin main
     ```

   - **SVN:** Similarly, commit TDRs to your SVN repository to maintain version history and collaboration.

2. **Organize TDRs:**

   - **Directory Structure:** Maintain a dedicated directory (e.g., `/docs/tdrs/`) within your repository to store all TDRs. This organization facilitates easy navigation and management.
   
   - **Naming Conventions:** Use clear and consistent naming conventions for TDR files, such as `TDR-<ID>-<Title>.<extension>`. For example, `TDR-101-Outdated-Auth-Library.md`.

3. **Link TDRs with Issues or ADRs:**

   - **Issue Tracking Integration:** Reference TDRs in your issue tracker (e.g., Jira, GitHub Issues) to provide context and track resolution progress.
   
   - **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs):** Link related ADRs to TDRs to maintain a comprehensive documentation trail of architectural decisions and their technical debt implications.

4. **Regular Review and Updates:**

   - **Periodic Audits:** Schedule regular reviews of TDRs to assess their current state, prioritize resolutions, and update statuses as work progresses.
   
   - **Continuous Improvement:** Encourage team members to document new technical debt promptly and update existing TDRs to reflect any changes.

5. **Access Control:**

   - **Permissions:** Ensure that only authorized team members can create, modify, or delete TDRs to maintain data integrity and accountability.
   
   - **Collaboration:** Use version control features like pull requests or merge requests to facilitate collaborative reviews and approvals of TDRs.
